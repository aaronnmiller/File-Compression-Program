# File-Compression-Program

This project was the final project for Data Structures. This project uses Huffman encoding and binary trees for file compression and storage. The program takes in a file and builds a frequency table of characters. It then creates a binary tree of the letters based off frequencies and then gets the codes from the tree. The output is then created using these codes.
